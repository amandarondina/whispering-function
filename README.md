# whispering-function

This is a part of last year's JavaScriptmas, a free annual festive coding event hosted by the online coding school Scrimba.<br>
I decided to use the challanges as inspiration for simple coding projects.

## Day 4
 >Write a function `whisper` that takes in a sentence and returns a new sentence in all lowercase letters with "shh..." at the beginning. The function should also remove an exclamation point at the end of the sentence, if there is one. 

Example:
```
input: "The KITTENS are SLEEPING!"
output: "shh... the kittens are sleeping"
```
